<h2>Your game title</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The purpose of this game is to catch the ball with the paddle in order to destroy all the bricks until there is nothing left. Every time the paddle misses the ball, one live is lost. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the players to feel relaxed, something that will destress you after a long day. The game doesnt involve much thought or strategy as the main goal is just to catch the ball with the paddle. 
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This game would probably fit in the arcade or mobile app game genre. 
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The main actions that player can perform is controlling the paddle to catch the ball. The game is pretty straightforward and little explanation is needed. Player can click on the screen to start the game and once all 3 lives are lost, the game will be over. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The game mechanic evaluated by this prototype is easy level coordination. 
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The game is very colorful and can be easily played by a variety of different audiences. 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
My game would probably be set in the clouds with colorful "characters" such as the bricks. The game has alot of colors and it is abstract. There is little strategy needed and all you really need to do is have fun! :) 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The game story will be similiar to something like a happy cartoon show. Since the game has no dramatic climax or agressiveness, the game should make player feel peaceful and relaxed, without any tension :) 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game mainly target children, but could target adults as well. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The game takes about 1 or 2 minutes to play. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I expect player to have at least minimum level of coordination. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
No, i borrowed them from phaser. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The game breakout most closely resembles my game.
